							<p>
								The traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has a constant interest rate and monthly payments that never change.
								This may be a good choice if you plan to stay in your home for seven years or longer. If you plan to move within seven years,
								then adjustable-rate loans are usually cheaper. As a rule of thumb, it may be harder to qualify for fixed-rate loans than for
								adjustable rate loans. When interest rates are low, fixed-rate loans are generally not that much more expensive than
								adjustable-rate mortgages and may be a better deal in the long run, because you can lock in the rate for the life of your loan.
